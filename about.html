            <h4>Where it all began</h4>
            <p>When I was a kid, you could always find me sitting in class scribbling something in a notebook. Things like logos for my favorite bands and random shapes or cartoon filled the pages.
              I would spend hours creating symbols and designs on my favorite video games. As I got older I took a few courses in high school and college in graphic design and web development.
              Friends would come to me to draw ideas for their group t-shirt, tattoos, or album covers for their indie band. I loved it, but never knew how I could turn it into a career.
              Once I graduated college, I found a full-time job at a day camp/ event facility as their Assistant Director. Working in a small business, I had a diverse set of responsibilities.
              My favorite was designing our websites, graphics, and marketing material. My time spent there helped me grow as a communicator, leader, and as a person. </p>

            <h4>My path to design</h4>
            <p>When I decided to leave my job, I started to apply for jobs. I would always look at the company’s website to get more information.
              When I would look at the different sites, I found myself thinking about how I would redesign their pages. I soon realized that my future was not in operations but in design.
              I did tons of research and decided to enroll in the Bloc program. Bloc helped me realize how my past experience translates to the design world.
              Conducting user surveys, and competitive analysis was part of my daily tasks. As a small start-up company, branding and content strategy were always a top priority.
              Bloc also helped me hone and complete my skills. I worked on several solo projects creating user flows, wireframes, Hifi Mockups, and prototypes for both desktop and mobile.
              I have conducted usability and preference tests to gauge interaction and create the best environment for the user.</p>

            <h4>Following my passion</h4>
            <p>As a person who is right down the middle between right and left-brain design allows both sides to shine. I enjoy finding the right spot for a word, or making a circle a few pixels bigger to make it feel right.
              Design allows me to express myself in ways I sometimes can’t with words. I always try to find ways to improve, instead of sticking to something because it’s always been done that way.
              Design is ever-evolving, and my goal is to be a part of guiding its evolution. Web accessibility it incredibly important to me. I would love to see not only standards improve, but made into laws.
              I am also very passionate about mental health education and research. I suffered many concussions as a child and have had my own battles with mental health.
              I advocate for awareness, to remove the stigma, and to let those suffering know it’s okay to ask for help. In the future I hope to communicate my support not only with words, but through design.</p>
